"""
This code  is aimed at designing a telegram bot(@AAU_Robot) for getting Grade reports 
and Profile informations for AAU students in a more faster way.
This bot cosidered many mistakes students may make: like unwanted space, omitted / or &
and shorter or longer username&password. Considering these common mistakes the bot will
not try to log in with these input to avoid account lock. 
This code wasn't able to perform what it is now performing with out the presence of:
1. Mechanize: for sign in and returning the response object of the website.
2. BeautifulSoup4: for extracting the important datas from the html response.
3. Python-telegram-bot(PTB): for communicating with telegram servers.
You have no idea how much time PTB saved for me.

    This function is is about scrping the AAit Portal.
    This function is the main part of @AAU_Robot.
    It gets the grade report and profile information of AAU student. This function 
    will be invoked anytime the user sends a text message.
    The function though will be happy only if it gets text like-
    UGR/blana/12&1234.
     Note:
    The bot will understand the above input as:

    ID No: UGR/blana/12
    Password: 1234

     Easy problems:
    These problems are problems that make robot reject the input before accessing
    the website.
    If user send shorter or longer ID&password combination than needed, or if user omitted /  and/or
    & sign and /or mis position them, different warnings will arrive.

     Hard Problems:
    The problems are problems that terminate the login process after the robtot
    tried to log in the website.

    The login request may fail due to many resons. If the ID No is correct and
    the password is wrong, the user will be  warned four times and the account will get
    locked after four wrong  attempts totaly with 5 worng inputs.
    If the username is wrong(not found, expired), user will get 'Incorrect username or password.' 
    warning message.
    And more badly if the website stopped working, the login failed message will arrive.

    "Your Grade Report was not found!" message may also arrive if the grade report field is
    empty.(May be this is on the first year first semester)
